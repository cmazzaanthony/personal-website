# Personal Website

A minimal personal website. Some HTML files, one CSS file, no build process.

The entire site is plain HTML with a touch of JavaScript to render markdown for blog posts. When I want to publish a post, I just create an HTML file and push it to GitHub Pages.

Sometimes the best solution is the one you can understand completely.
